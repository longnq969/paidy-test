
# This config file supports variable substitution which enables: 1) keeping
# secrets out of source control & 2) environment-based configuration changes
# such as staging vs prod.
#
# When GE encounters substitution syntax (like `my_key: ${my_value}` or
# `my_key: $my_value`) in the great_expectations.yml file, it will attempt
# to replace the value of `my_key` with the value from an environment
# variable `my_value` or a corresponding key read from this config file,
# which is defined through the `config_variables_file_path`.
# Environment variables take precedence over variables defined here.
#
# Substitution values defined here can be a simple (non-nested) value,
# nested value such as a dictionary, or an environment variable (i.e. ${ENV_VAR})
